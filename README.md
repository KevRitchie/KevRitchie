### Hi there, my name's Kev or Kevin if I'm trouble! 😂

I’m a Development Director and software developer working primarily in C# and building things in the ☁. A long way from changing screen colours and making music on my C64 back in the early 80s.

🌱 I’m currently learning all about Azure, but happy to help anyone in the community on their software development journey.

Outside of work at [Paradise Computing Ltd](https://www.paradisecomputing.co.uk/), I’m a Squadron Leader in the Royal Air Force Air Cadets and a Sector Commander for [South & East Midlands Wing ATC](https://semidsatc.org.uk/), responsible for providing support and guidance to 6 Squadron Commanders across Northamptonshire and South Leicestershire. I was previously Commanding Officer at [422 (Corby) Squadron Royal Air Force Air Cadets](http://422corbyatc.co.uk/), one of the largest Squadrons in the Air Training Corps.

⚡ Fun fact: I used to be in a metal band playing lead 🎸 back in the early 2000s 🤘
